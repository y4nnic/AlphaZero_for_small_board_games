Implementation of AlphaZero for TicTacToe.

The algorithm was implemented in Python3.
Used packages:
	numpy 1.15.2
	keras 2.2.2
	tensorflow 1.10.0
	tensorboard 1.10.0
	matplotlib 3.0.0
	pandas 0.23.4
	jupyter 1.0.0

Use "experiment_tictactoe" to run the algorithm. It should achieve a win rate of 70-80% (10-20% draw).

You need to create the folders "logs/" and "saved/neural_networks" in order to run the program.
